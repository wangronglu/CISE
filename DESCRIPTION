Description: Specific dimension reduction methods for replicated graphs 
    (multiple undirected graphs repeatedly measured on a common set of 
    nodes). The package contains efficient procedures for estimating 
    a shared baseline propensity matrix and graph-specific low rank 
    matrices. The algorithm uses block coordinate descent algorithm to 
    solve the model as described in the paper linked to via the URL below, 
    which alternatively performs L2-penalized logistic regression and 
    multiple partial eigenvalue decompositions.
